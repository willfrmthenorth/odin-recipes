        <h2>Description</h2>
        
        A juicy, hearty steak sandwich is the best thing to banish midday hunger pangs or pair with a glass of wine for a fun take on steak dinner. Find your new favorite sandwich (a great go-to healthy lunch) in a toasted ciabatta roll piled high with grilled hanger steak, peppery arugula, Parmesan cheese and quick-pickled onions. Before grilling, the steak gets marinated in balsamic vinegar, whole-grain mustard and Dijon mustard for an acidic, spicy-sweet kick. Pair that with lemony arugula and salty Parmesan and this sandwich hits every flavor note. We’re getting hungry just thinking about it!

        <p>Hosting a small crowd? Turn the sandwich into an easy appetizer by leaving it open-faced and letting everyone snack on steak toasts. Think of it as a meatier, heartier take on bruschetta that’ll have your guests reaching for seconds and thirds. It just might outshine the main!</p>
            
        <p>This sandwich works with any cut of steak you like. We love hanger or tri tip, both tender, meaty cuts ideal for grilling. If you’re unsure how to navigate the meat counter, simply ask the butcher for guidance.</p>
